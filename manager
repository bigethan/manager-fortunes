You listen.

%
You're aware of the small, subtle, perhaps subconscious, actions that marginalize people in underrepresented groups. Because you're aware of the cumulative damage these things cause, and the emotional toll often born by the victim, you act swiftly to address that behavior when it arises amongst your people.
%
You've learned that the tech world is not in fact a meritocracy, so you pay attention to who does the tasks that are most valued, who gets to take initiative and ensure they're not just the loudest, or most privileged. Similarly, you pay attention to who experiences more friction, and work to redress any inequity.

You notice when someone is frustrated, struggling, or bored at work. Whether they tell you or you just sense it coming, when you notice this: you stop, make time to listen and tend to them and the cause.
